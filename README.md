# Neural Network Loss Function Comparison

## Overview
This project compares the impact of **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)** loss functions in training a neural network for binary classification.

## Features
- Generates **synthetic binary classification data**.
- Defines a **feedforward neural network** using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Trains two models using **MSE** and **BCE** as loss functions.
- **Visualizes** the loss function behavior during training.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
